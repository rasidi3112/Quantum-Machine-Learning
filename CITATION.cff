abstract: >
  This repository presents a comparative experimental study of hybrid quantum-classical learning 
  models using PennyLane, PyTorch, and Qiskit. 
  It implements both Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) and Quantum Kernel SVM (QSVM) architectures 
  for binary classification tasks, highlighting differences in performance and design between 
  variational and kernel-based quantum models.
  
  The project follows international research standards for reproducibility, modular configuration, 
  and open scientific development.
